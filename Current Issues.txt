Hello I am currently having a issue with my installer setup 

I managed to make the usb bootable and load into the macos installer but keeps defaulting into Russian, I have gone thru the bios about 3 times and disabled all features/options that the guide ask to,
reformatted drive, while ignoring the Russian and go about install macos it gives some error in Russian sadly, I am a USA english speaker so I don't know Russian lol
I also do have a real issue of the mouse buttons won't work, yet the mousepad does move the mouse around I am having to use external mouse to click, this was the case when I was last capable of
going into the installer

I was able to go into the installer untell I did this bellow 

Currently having issues setting language, I have done nvreset on all attempts I have blanked "prev-lang:kbd" so it would show the language choice and "prev-lang:kbd	 String	 en-US:0" and even done 
"NVRAM -> Delete -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> Item 0 | String | prev-lang:kbd" which doing so booted then hit a gray screen with the mouse being moveable and since then its been booting
on this blank screen ever since then

I have re-flashed bios and redone settings, cleared usb and repartitioned it, redid the plist config. and swaped out from MacBookPro10,1 and MacBookPro9,1 and hasnt done anything it this regard
Was capable of atleast going into the installer but, Honustly speaking I think this may be a bios issue and as I have stated I have tried re-flashing bios and I have attempted to clear cmos
how Hp recommends it. hold win + v and power for 3 sec and didnt show a message or anything

Current Goals
Trying to get macos to boot while its installed on main drive then work on stuff outside of that.

I am giving a plist config that I copy and edited, So most stuff I am troubleshooting won't show up on this config

currently using another machine with windows 11 to edit usb etc and also used diskpart to partition usb, using the plist editor Propertree

Using the current GenSMBIOS option 3 and using info for MacBookPro10,1 and MacBookPro9,1

If having Mac OS ignore the gpu is the better answer I am not against the idea

My Hp Elitebook 8570w is on latest Firmware on website

I have Done
for Nvidia on Monterey
Kernel > Misc > Security and change SecureBootModel from Default to Disabled
NVRAM > 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 and change csr-active-config from 00000000 to 02080000

On all attempts and the first time I did this I was capable of going into the installer

Looking for any help, I appreciate your time and effort

Very sorry if this causes any inconvinence, I have been working on this for 2 to 3 days and figured it would be best to get some help from people that know the machine better
